JavaScript
Is an interpreted language that runs in the web browser.
The web browser has the motor or interpreter that understand the JavaScript code.

## 0-syntax.js file:
This file explain that JavaScript is a dinamic typed language. That means that you
can to use any type of value in a variable without specify the type manually.

Also shows you how to call a value or function inside of an array, using the index.
The file also tell you that is possible writen sentences without semicolons and that
is possible declare strings using double and single cuotes.

## 1-types.js file
Exist different types of values, as:
Boolean
Number
String
Function
Objects

You can see the type by using the function "typeof"

## 2-objects.js
Exists some different ways for create objects... One of them is:
writing for example:
```const o = new Object()```
and then you can fill the object using the *dot notation*
example:
```const o = new Object()
    o.firstName = "Daniel";
    o.lastName = 'Ramirez';
    o.isLearning = True;
    o.greet = function(){
        console.log('hi!');
    }
Another way is using the literal object, that is:
´´´casdfas´´´
